Week 6 Project:
This week's exercise will be a bit more open-ended: find some neat API on the internet, grab some data from it via fetch,
and display it in a React app in a cool way! If you have time, try to practice using multiple React components: for example,
make the fetch api call in 'App.js' and pass it down to be displayed to a child component. For a bonus challenge, you can try to make the api call based off of user input.
Please work in groups of 2-3, and meet with each other at least once this following week to work on this.
